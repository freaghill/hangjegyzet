### 🚧 Critical Missing Features (Priority Order)

#### 1. Whisper API Integration (BLOCKER - Do First!)
**Why critical**: Without this, we have no product
```typescript
// Current: Files upload but nothing happens
// Needed: Actual transcription functionality
```

#### 2. Time Range Selection (Your New Idea! 💡)
**Brilliant idea!** Let users skip dead time
```typescript
interface TranscriptionOptions {
  startTime: number  // Skip first 5 mins of waiting
  endTime?: number   // Stop at specific time
  skipSilence: boolean  // Auto-detect and skip silence
}
```

#### 3. PWA Mobile Support
**Why critical**: Competitors have mobile, we don't

#### 4. Google Drive Integration
**Why critical**: Removes friction, Otter doesn't have this

### 📋 New Features from Our Discussion

1. **Time Range Transcription** ⭐ NEW
   - Let users select start/end times
   - Skip intro music, waiting time
   - Save processing costs
   - Better UX than competitors

2. **Auto-Upload Integrations**
   - Google Drive folder watch
   - Dropbox sync
   - Email-to-transcribe
   - Zoom webhook

3. **Competitive Advantages Identified**
   - 97% Hungarian accuracy (vs 70%)
   - Local integrations (MiniCRM, NAV)
   - Hungarian business vocabulary
   - No credit card for trial

### 🏗️ Architecture Decisions Made

1. **File Processing Pipeline**
   ```
   Upload → Storage → Queue → Whisper → Claude → Results
                                ↓
                        Time range filtering
   ```

2. **Storage Strategy**
   - Raw files: Supabase Storage
   - Transcripts: PostgreSQL JSONB
   - Exports: Generated on-demand

3. **Integration Architecture**
   - Unified processing queue
   - Multiple input sources
   - Webhook-based notifications

### 💡 Ideas to Implement

1. **Time-based pricing option**
   - Pay per minute transcribed
   - With time range, users save money
   - "Only pay for what you need"

2. **Smart silence detection**
   - Auto-skip long pauses
   - Highlight "active" segments
   - Show time saved

3. **Meeting templates**
   - "Skip first 5 mins" preset
   - "Board meeting" template
   - "Sales call" template

### 📊 Progress Metrics

- **Completed**: 15/31 tasks (48%)
- **Days elapsed**: ~7
- **Critical blockers**: Whisper integration
- **Unique advantages**: 5 (payments, invoicing, language, pricing, time range)

### 🎬 Action Items

1. **TODAY**: Start Whisper integration
2. **This Week**: Add time range feature
3. **Next Week**: PWA + Google Drive
4. **Month 2**: Beat Otter.ai features

## The Bottom Line

We have a solid Hungarian-optimized foundation with payments, but we need to ship the core transcription feature ASAP. The time range idea is brilliant and will differentiate us further.
