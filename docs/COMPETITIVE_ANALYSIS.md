## 🔥 Aggressive Pricing Strategy

### Destroy Otter.ai's Pricing
```
Otter Pro: $16.99 = ~6,000 Ft
Us: 24,900 Ft but 3x more value
- More minutes (2000 vs 1200)
- Hungarian accuracy
- Local support
- No credit card required
```

### Free Tier That Hurts Competitors
```
Them: 10 recordings or trials
Us: 500 minutes/month forever
Why: Hook them, they'll never leave
```

## 🛠️ Technical Advantages We'll Build

### 1. Speed

- Real-time processing for live meetings
- Edge caching for instant playback

### 3. Intelligence

## 📱 The Mobile Strategy

### Don't Build Native (Yet)
**Why competitors' apps aren't great:**
- Otter app: Buggy, drains battery
- Fireflies: No mobile app
- tl;dv: No mobile app

**Our approach:**
1. Perfect mobile web experience
2. PWA for installation
3. Native app only when we hit €50k MRR

**You say**: "We perfect 1 language - yours"

That's how David beats Goliath. 🎯
